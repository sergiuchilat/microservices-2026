# Homework: Anatomy of a Distributed System

### 1. Case Study: Netflix's "Chaos Monkey" (Research)
Netflix was the first major company to claim: *"In a system with thousands of microservices, something will fail every minute. We might as well trigger these failures ourselves."*

* **Task:** Research what **"Chaos Monkey"** (part of the Simian Army) is.
* **Question:** How does this approach improve **security** and **resilience**, specifically addressing the "isolation of failure" concept we discussed in class?

### 2. Protocols: JSON vs. Protobuf (Technical Comparison)
We previously discussed **REST** and **gRPC** as primary communication methods.

* **Task:** Find an example of how the same data (e.g., a `user_id`, `email`, and `status`) is represented in **JSON** (text-based) versus **Protocol Buffers** (binary-based).
* **Goal:** Be prepared to explain why gRPC is more efficient in terms of bandwidth and parsing speed for internal communication.

### 3. The Database Dilemma (Critical Thinking)
In a monolith, we have a single database with tables linked by `Foreign Keys`. In microservices, we follow the **Database-per-Service** pattern.

* **Scenario:** * The **Order Service** has its own database.
    * The **User Service** has its own database.
* **The Problem:** How can the *Order Service* ensure a `user_id` is valid if it cannot perform a `JOIN` or a direct query on the *User Service's* database?
* **Task:** Propose a logical solution or workflow to solve this data dependency without breaking the "independence" of the services.

### 💡 Preparation for Next Lesson: "Where do Microservices live?"
To get ready for tomorrow's lecture, quickly look up the definitions of:
1.  **Stateless vs. Stateful** applications.
2.  **Containerization** (specifically, what problem does **Docker** solve that a simple Virtual Machine doesn't?).
